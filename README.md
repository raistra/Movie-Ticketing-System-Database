# Movie Ticketing System Database

This project involves designing a SQL database for an online movie ticketing system, which will be implemented using SQLite3 in Python. This involves creating a database schema to store information about movies, theaters, showtimes, and tickets, as well as implementing queries to retrieve and update this information. The goal of the project is to create a functional and efficient database that can support the ticketing system and provide useful insights into customer behavior and ticket sales
